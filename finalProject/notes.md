NOTES AND STUFF

Bugs I've Noticed
- **FIXED** new words don't spawn in the right place and i have NO IDEA why
- **FIXED** unlimited words yikes
- **FIXED** words can be dragged off poem canvas
- **FIXED** words are sometimes longer than their magnets; make length of magnet depend on word??
- **SORT OF FIXED** words all show up in the center of the page and overlap into a horrible   alphabet clusterfuck
- **FIXED** some magnet colours are SUPER dark
- **FIXED until i notice otherwise** comb through word lists for errors (words with variant   
  spellings are both displayed) and for words that could potentially be used for evil (the word Jewish is included and i know that /i/ won't use it for evil, but someone else might especially given the alarming amount of neonazi bastards on the internet. i dont want anyone to be hurt using my poem program)
- **FIXED** plurals of words arent available. make a button that provides an "s"?
- particle generation generates uh. a lot of useless things and not enough the/a/it
- **FIXED** profanity words return undefined?? no cursing allowed i guess
- a lot of particles show up in the core word list, comb thru list and eliminate them?? similarly, words have doubles with endings (ex: sand, sanded), get ride of those too? yeesh see yall in five years
