*************************************CHAPTER 1: echo (echo,(echo,(echooooooo))

when youre gonna do php stuff in atom , dont forget to download the PHP server package
http://php.net/manual/en/install.php
thats a website you can use if youre missing stuff/need help setting up

make a .php file and set it up like an html file. to use php stuff you gotta put it in php script tags, which look like this:

<?php
  echo "jsdfdgdg text aosijgdoij";
?>

functions arent case sensitive, BUT VARIABLES ARE!!

php variables start with a $ sign

echo and print functions are mostly the same. echo functions are cool because you can put html markup in them and itll understand

you can make "objects" in php that store data and how to process it (functions)

example:

  class Car {
    function Car() {
      $this->model = "VW"
    }
  }

you can create instances of that class and specify information about them.

example:

  $punchBuggie = new Car;
  echo $punchBuggie->model

so this says that punchBuggie is a new car, then it goes back to the class and sees that Ah, the model should be VW, so it prints that onscreen.
