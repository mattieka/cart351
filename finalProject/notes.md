NOTES AND STUFF

Bugs I've Noticed
- **FIXED** new words don't spawn in the right place and i have NO IDEA why
- **FIXED** unlimited words yikes
- **FIXED** words can be dragged off poem canvas
- **FIXED** words are sometimes longer than their magnets; make length of magnet depend on word??
- **SORT OF FIXED** words all show up in the center of the page and overlap into a horrible   alphabet clusterfuck
- **FIXED** some magnet colours are SUPER dark
- **FIXED until i notice otherwise** comb through word lists for errors (words with variant   
  spellings are both displayed) and for words that could potentially be used for evil (the word Jewish is included and i know that /i/ won't use it for evil, but someone else might especially given the alarming amount of neonazi bastards on the internet. i dont want anyone to be hurt using my poem program)
- **FIXED** plurals of words arent available. make a button that provides an "s"?
- **FIXED** particle generation generates uh. a lot of useless things and not enough the/a/it
- **FIXED** profanity words return undefined?? no cursing allowed i guess
- a lot of particles show up in the core word list, comb thru list and eliminate them?? similarly, words have doubles with endings (ex: sand, sanded), get ride of those too? yeesh see yall in five years
- if you click on any of the extra buttons really fast the program explodes

Stuff to Do

poem canvas stuff to do
- ***DONE!*** move word generation button off the poem canvas
- ***DONE!*** actually get "magnets" to display random words
- ***DONE!*** make word subdivisions (nouns, adjectives, etc)
- make different buttons for each word subdivision
- let user post/save their poem (take screenshot and upload/download it?)
- ***DONE!*** trash can to get rid of words
- ***DONE!*** remove word count limit?? that could be more fun than limiting
- make something similar to trash can that lets you duplicate a word

brainstorming on how to do things

gallery: gallery div js file spawns a new div inside it with a poem it pulls from the database. default setting is to display most recent poems . other options are to sort by popularity or to just show a random poem.

----------

1) Make other pages!!!
  - homepage
  - gallery page

2) Let users save/post their poem!!!

3) Gallery functionality!!
