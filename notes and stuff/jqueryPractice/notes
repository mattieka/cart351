NOTES


*************************************CHAPTER 1: mattie learns about selectors

jquery commands are all about selecting a thing to change , then indicating what you want to change about it
  syntax is $(selector).action()

  selector = thing u wanna change
  action = how you wanna change the thing
  $ = holler holler get dollar, never forget it

the selectors tend to be elements that exist in an html document

jquery uses the same syntax as CSS to select elements

----------------------------------

before you do anything in jquery its good to have a document ready function which looks like this:

$(document).ready(function(){
   // jQuery methods go here...
});

this is so that the functions don't happen before the page is fully loaded because then itll explode and you jsut die

----------------------------------

example: you can select html element names and it changes them all , so if you did smth like

  $("p")

you're targeting all of the paragraph (p) elements. and ofc you can nest them in another jquery command

----------------------------------

like in css, you can select elements by ID which you give w/ the good ol #idName . call for it like this

  $("#idName")

class is the same too, its .className , so

  $(".className")

-----------------------------------

hot tip: to avoid your html file becoming a cluttered warzone, put ur jquery/other javascript stuff in separate files
just dont forget to include the command in the head that lets computer read them

<head>
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js">
  </script>
  <script src="my_jquery_functions.js"></script>
</head>



*************************************CHAPTER 2: mattie learns about events

generally users do things on web pages, like click and scroll or press keys. stuff like that are called "events"

get hip with the lingo: when an event is triggered by something, you use the word "fired" . use exactly the same as youd use the word triggered

    example: the keypress event is fired the moment you press a key

also, "methods" i think means the things that happen in a function. (actions?)

--------------------------------

define what happens in an event like this

    $("p").click(function() {
        cool stuff that happens when p is clicked goes here
      });

HEY! quick heads up. you gotta end jquery functions with the hot mess of });, because god is dead i guess

there are lots of event handlers that exist already so google them like some kinda animal

--------------------------------

but WAIT, theres MORE

  you can have multiple event handlers attached to one selector by using the on() function.

      $("p").on({
      mouseenter: function(){
        $(this).css("background-color", "lightgray");
        },
        mouseleave: function(){
        $(this).css("background-color", "lightblue");
        },
        click: function(){
        $(this).css("background-color", "yellow");
        }
      });

amazing

again im not going to write or memorize every method that exists for jquery so just google it

******************************CHAPTER 3: mattie finally uncovers the mysteries behind callback functions

callback functions are functions that you put INSIDE the parameters of an action, which will execute AFTER the inital action is ajaxComplete
thats not even CLOSE to what i thought a callback function did but anyway, ive been enlightened

------------

CHAINING! just like for SHINIES in POKEMON! except thats not what it is here so i dont care

thats not actually

chaining is when you apply multiple event handlers to a selector at the same time without having to make them separate statements

you just "append" the next on you want right after it. i really thought "append" meant "subtract" when in fact it means the opposite
my whole life has been a lie

    example: $("#p1").css("color", "red").slideUp(2000).slideDown(2000);

this is a hot mess to look at , and i hate it, so you can write it like this just fine:

    $("#p1").css("color", "red")
        .slideUp(2000)
        .slideDown(2000);

if you do this though, make sure only the last one has a semicolon or else the program will be like "what the fuck, richard"

********************************* CHAPTER 4: the DOM

i hate that fanfic has given me a completely different idea of what "dom" is and i'll never be free again

in this case, DOM means Document Object Model. this makes it EVEN EASIER to manipulate elements and attributes apparently.

google these also
