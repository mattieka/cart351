CREATE A SIMPLE VISUAL COMPOSITION:

ONLY use the canvas + javascript –> NO external libraries (p5 etc…)

HAS to have at least ONE custom object definition
    - Make sure that this object is instantiated and used in your composition

ANIMATE at least one of the components

HAVE at least one event listener
    - Make sure that the event triggered “activates” one of your components
            - (i.e. I click on a sphere).
    - This component should change OVER time in some way when activated by an event.

THE REST: is up to you & you can use code from class (or external resources).


BONUS:
Implement the functionality to allow for one of your components to be “activated” by the mouse press.
Write the code that will then determine HOW long the mouse was pressed for (on the component).
Affect the component using this derived information.
